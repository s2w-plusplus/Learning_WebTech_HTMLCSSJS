<div>
	
	<p>
		A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up
		by many layers (strata) of hardened lava and tephra. Unlike shield volcanoes, 
		stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and 
		periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some
		have collapsed summit craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes
		typically cools and hardens before spreading far, due to high viscosity.
		The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of
		silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. 
		Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15 km (9.3 mi).

	    Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called "composite volcanoes" because of their composite stratified
		structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials. They are among the most
		common types of volcanoes, in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes. Two famous
		examples of stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in Indonesia, known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883,
		and Vesuvius in Italy, whose catastrophic eruption in AD 79 buried the Roman cities of Pompeii and 
		Herculaneum. Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives. In modern times, Mount St. Helens in Washington
		State, USA and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines have erupted catastrophically, but with fewer deaths.

		The possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the Solar System has not been 
		conclusively demonstrated. One possible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars,
		for example the Zephyria Tholus.

		Stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic
		boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust (continental arc volcanism,
		e.g. Cascade Range, Andes, Campania) or another oceanic plate (island arc volcanism, e.g. Japan,
		Philippines, Aleutian Islands). The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in
		hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle
		rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab. The release of water from hydrated
		minerals is termed "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral,
		as the plate descends to greater depths. The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point 
		of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter
		density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily at the base of the 
		lithosphere. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica-rich crustal rock,
		leading to a final intermediate composition. When the magma nears the top surface, it 
		pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano.

		The processes that trigger the final eruption remain a matter of research. Possible mechanisms include:<br>
		<ul style="font-size:20px">
			<li>
				Magma differentiation, in which the lightest, most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water, halogens,
				and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber. This can dramatically increase pressures.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fractional crystallization of the magma. When anhydrous minerals such as feldspar crystallize out of the magma,
				this concentrates volatiles in the remaining liquid, which can lead to second boiling that causes a gas phase 
				(carbon dioxide or water) to separate from the liquid magma and raise magma chamber pressures.
			</li>
			<li>
				Injection of fresh magma into the magma chamber, which mixes and heats the cooler magma already present.
				This could force volatiles out of solution and lower the density of the cooler magma, both of which increase 
				pressure. There is considerable evidence for magma mixing just prior to many eruptions, including magnesium-rich
				olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim. This is possible only if the lava erupted
				immediately after mixing, since olivine rapidly reacts with silicic magma to form a rim of pyroxene.
			</li>
			<li>
				Progressive melting of the surrounding country rock.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		These internal triggers may be modified by external triggers such as sector collapse, earthquakes, or interactions with groundwater.
		Some of these triggers operate only under limited conditions. For example, sector collapse (where part of the flank of a volcano
		collapses in a massive landslide) can trigger eruption only of a very shallow magma chamber. Magma differentiation and thermal
		expansion also are ineffective as triggers for eruptions from deep magma chambers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whatever the precise mechanism, the pressure in the magma chamber increases to a critical point where the roof of the magma
		chamber fractures and the contents of the magma chamber are provided with a path to the surface through which to erupt.
